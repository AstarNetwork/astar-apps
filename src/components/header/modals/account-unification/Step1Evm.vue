      To create an unified account, both Substrate and EVM wallet extension are required and
      currently not possible from mobile apps.

        Unified account is owned by an Astar Native account. Please connect with a desired address
        and create an account.

      <astar-button class="btn" @click="handleBack()">Select a wallet</astar-button>

      <p>
        You can receive full benefit while you are connecting with EVM account without unifying. So
        nothing to worry if you donâ€™t own a Astar Native account. However there might be a feature
        that the unified account can benefit and you could always create an account anytime.

        You could also find Substrate based wallets which might be friendlier.
